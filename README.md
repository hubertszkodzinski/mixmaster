This is the application where I thoroughly learned React Router Dom and consolidated my knowledge of React Query. Additionally, when creating this application, I used Axios, Styled Components and React Toastify. The API I was sending requests to was https://www.thecocktaildb.com/. 

This application allows the user to search for information about the drink he is interested in. 

The user can subscribe to the newsletter, which I created using the Form component of React Router Dom and handled with the help of Action assigned to a specific page defined in my router, of course in an asynchronous way. To provide the user with data downloaded from the API better and more efficiently, I used the Loader from React Router Dom together with React Query.
